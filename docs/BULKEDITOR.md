## Bulk editor

To access the bulk editor, you need to navigate to the devices.php page and click on the button with the pencil next to the table heading

![Open bulkeditor][open_bulkeditor]

A new page will now open showing all detected hosts in alphabetical order with a checkbox. The respective checkbox can be set via the host name as well as via the checkbox itself. Only selected hosts will apply the changes made.

![Bulkeditor enable field][Enable_field]

To be able to edit a value, the input field must be activated via the respective checkbox (red circle) at the beginning of the line. If the checkbox is deactivated again, the input field is cleared.

With the Save button, the changes are saved in the database without further questions. A summary of the changed devices with the changed values is displayed.
