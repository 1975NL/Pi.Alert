It also warns of the disconnection of "always connected" devices.

### Componets
The system consists of two parts:

- **Back**: in charge of scanning the network searching connected devices, store the information in the DB, and reporting the changes detected by e-mail.

- **Front**: a web frontal that allows to display, in a visual way, all the information collected by the back.
